                | I'm interested in researching and following best practice to achieve UX and design goals. #[a(href="https://www.circulardesignguide.com/" target="_blank") Circular Design] is a methodology
                | that can be applied the full gamut of design and business. 
            p
                | It's a way of looking at problems and systems to find iterative solutions that work all the way through the product life cycle.
                | It can be applied to every step of the UX journey, from identifying user personas, discovering their wants and needs, to developing early prototypes and finally progressive enhancements based on real world data.
            p
                | UX isn't something that exists in isolation on a screen - UX can touch every part of a brand or company, from the first moment a customer hears the name to the business practices
                | and techniques used to deliver the product. 
                | Circular design and good UX can be brought to bear on every facet of a product and business - why shouldn't your staff have a great experience of your product as well as your customers?
                
            p
                | When it comes to development of those solutions, I adopt high efficiency project managment practices, working with KANBAN boards, sprints and agile working practices. I'm also fully versed in source control and always use it in my own projects.

            p
                | Working up a sensible response to any design or UX problem starts with a simple question that can be tricky to answer - who is this for?
            p
                | To answer this kind of question takes gathering and digging through as much data you can possibly get your hands on and then making the correct interpretation based off that.

                | What are their pains? Once you have these answers, you can start thinking about how you can influence them, convert visitors into users or customers.
