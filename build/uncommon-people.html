Did you know that The Human League are connected to Arctic Monkeys through only one other band? Or the briefly lived Richard Hawley project Teenage Werewolf boasted
members from Pulp, The Longpigs and I Monster? Uncommon People allows you to move around these connections fluidly through a constantly moving organic structure. </p><img class="image" src="/images/uncommon-people-2.png" alt="Uncommon People"><p>The website runs from a MySQL relational database of bands, people and the roles they played in those bands, then generates an XML document that's read in by
a Flash movie built with Away3d. I designed and built everything from the logo and interaction patterns to the database and admin system.</p><p>  Sadly it's suffering a bit these days from being a bit unloved in terms of technology and a bit too loved from
it's owners adding more bands than was originally planned for.</p></div></div><div class="grid-x align-center"><div class="cell small-12"><img class="image" src="/images/uncommon-people-3.png" alt="Uncommon People"><p class="text-center"><a class="button" href="index">Go back</a></p></div></div></main><div class="modal grid-x align-middle align-center" id="modal"><div class="cell small-11 text-center"><img class="modal-img" id="modalImg" src="/images/sharrow-fringe.jpg" alt="#"></div></div><footer class="grid-container footer"><p>2017 Martin Alcock is cool</p></footer><script src="/js/lib/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/lib/chart.min.js"></script><script src="/js/lib/chartjs-plugin-deferred.min.js"></script><script src="/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
